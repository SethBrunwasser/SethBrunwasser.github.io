			<h3>Software</h3>
			<p>The software sector is a rapidly changing industry. Huge well known companies such as Uber, Lyft, Snapchat, and many more did not exist even 10 years ago. Such technologies were thought to be impossible and outragous or not profitable.</p>
			<p>This is why I am thankful to have the opportunity to live in a time where we are able to implement brilliant ideas that solve complex problems in our every day lives.</p>
			<p>As a current Computer Science student, I am fascinated by the many facets of the software domain. In the summer of 2017, I had the opportunity to be a Machine Learning Intern for a fortune 500 company. This was an amazing experience. I learned a ton about data science and the problems associated with it. Most importantly, I learned the process of understanding a complicated problem in a business context and the process of turning that into a technical solution.</p>
			<p>The first year at my university, I spent most of my time outside of classes learning and developing in Python. This eventually lead to my Machine Learning Internship where all of my work was using Python. As we hear today, Python is one of the fastest growing languages. This is due to its powerful built in library and super simple readability.</p>
			<p>After the summer ended, I realized that the code I wrote in Python was simply just a protype for the Software Engineers to implement into Web Applications which would be used by customers. This influenced me to begin learning Web Developement. While this was flustering as there are countless JavaScript frameworks and flavors, I buckled down and decided to start with a simple backend with flask, a Python Microframework. This was the perfect balance for me to use previous knowledge and for me to also expand my horizons.</p>
